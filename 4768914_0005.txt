STATEMENT ΟΝ nupt-teme tMAGES

This reei of microfiim contains materiai
witich has paper coior changes steinS, or
illustrations (some of which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that eii text enci illustratione are
ieqibie‚ exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore‚ when text end illustrations exist
in a sinqie image or when materiai
beoquouncis differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure refieots the camera
operator’s best effort to capture the majority
of tite text; the second exposure reflects tite

camera operator’s best effort to capture

iilustrative materiai or the remaining text. it
is hoped that this practice wiii result in a
miorofiim product that tuiiy serves tite needs
of most reseerohers
